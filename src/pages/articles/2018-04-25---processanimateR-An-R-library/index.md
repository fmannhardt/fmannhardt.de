In the past weeks, I worked on the processanimateR library, which enables to create custom token animations based on process maps created through BupaRâ€™s processmapR library. 
The functionality is still pretty basic (no rewind / time control) only one loop through the animation, but it provides some nice features such as customizable token color or size based on a secondary data frame.
