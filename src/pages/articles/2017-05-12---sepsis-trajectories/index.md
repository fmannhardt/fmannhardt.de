A while ago I could make an anonymized version of the Sepsis Cases event log available on the 4TU data center:

```
Mannhardt, F (Felix) (2016)   
Sepsis Cases - Event Log. Eindhoven University of Technology. Dataset.  
http://dx.doi.org/10.4121/uuid:915d2bfb-7e84-49ad-a286-dc35f063a460
```

The event log is based on several months of work that I carried out together with a regional hospital in The Netherlands. 
I hope that this event log will be useful for other process-mining researchers to validate/challenge their methods. 

Since it is always nice to have some more background on the case, I wrote a lesson-learned paper for the BPMDS workshop together with Daan Blinde, who helped with the project. The paper is due to appear in the BPMDS’2017 RADAR proceedings:

```
F. Mannhardt, D. Blinde (2017). 
Analyzing the Trajectories of Patients with Sepsis using Process Mining.   
In RADAR+EMISA 2017, pp. 72–80.
```

The paper is available [here](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1859/bpmds-08-paper.pdf). I will gladly be answering questions on the event log and paper.
