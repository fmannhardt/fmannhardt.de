I defended my PhD thesis [**Multi-perspective Process Mining**](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/multi-perspective-process-mining) on the 7th February 2018. The thesis provides in-depth description of several Process Mining techniques that deal with situations in which multiple process perspectives (control-flow, data, resource, time, etc.) are intertwined and considered together. If you just want to get an overview, here is an [extended abstract](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2196/BPM_2018_paper_9.pdf) summarizing the main contributions.
