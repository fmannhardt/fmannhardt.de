## Assistant Professor -- TU Eindhoven

Since September 2020, I am working as Assistant Professor (or [Universitair Docent](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universitair_docent)) at the [Process Analytics (PA) group](https://pa.win.tue.nl/) of the Eindhoven University of Technology. The PA group is lead by Boudewijn van Dongen and was born out of the AIS group in which I obtained my PhD.

## Co-founder -- KIT-AR

I co-founded [KIT-AR](https://www.kit-ar.com/), a spin-off company building an innovate industrial AR solution. Here the focus of my work is the combination of machine learning to detect and identify relevant activities (activity recognition) and a process-centric view on the work execution (workflow management, process mining) paired with an augmented reality system.
