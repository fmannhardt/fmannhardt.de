Hi, I am researching and applying Process Mining in various settings and in conjunction with other Data Science and Machine Learning methods. I am particularly interested in connecting low-level events to business activities and in researching trust and privacy aspects of Process Mining.

## Forsker -- SINTEF

I am working as Research Scientist (Forsker) at the [Department of Technology Management](https://www.sintef.no/en/technology-and-society/industrial_management/) of [SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/) in beautiful Trondheim, Norway.

## PhD -- Multi-perspective Process Mining

Early 2018, I received my PhD degree from the Technical University of Eindhoven based on my thesis [**Multi-perspective Process Mining**](/thesis).

I worked in the [AIS group](http://www.win.tue.nl/ais/) and was supported by the awesome team of [Hajo A. Reijers](http://reijers.com), [Wil M.P. van der Aalst](http://vdaalst.com/), and [Massimiliano de Leoni](http://www.win.tue.nl/~mdeleoni/).
