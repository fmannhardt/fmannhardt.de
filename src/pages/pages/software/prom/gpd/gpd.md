## Overview

![](log-abstraction.png)

A supervised abstraction method based on behavioral activity patterns that capture domain knowledge on the relation between activities and events. Through an alignment between the activity patterns and the low-level event logs an abstracted event log is obtained. Events in the abstracted event log correspond to instantiations of recognizable activities.
