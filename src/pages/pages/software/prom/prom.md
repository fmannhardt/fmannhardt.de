I developed several tools and open-source software packages for the process mining framework <a href="http://promtools.org">ProM</a> and it RapidMiner variant <a href="http://rapidprom.org">RapidProM</a>. Some of the software is also available outside of ProM at my <a href="https://github.com/fmannhardt">personal GitHub page</a>.

Most of the ProM packages and plug-ins are included in one of the stable release versions, which are released every year to help keeping results reproducable. However, since any non-trivial software contains errors, which is especially so for academic prototypes, I advise to use the latest version available in the <a href="http://www.promtools.org/doku.php?id=nightly">nightly builds</a> of the ProM framework. It is sufficient to install the nightly build version once and, then, update the packages regularly. In fact, if you do not update packages you can enjoy a stable version using a nightly build installation. So, usually, there is not reason to install one of the <i>frozen</i> version unless you want to reproduce some result reported to be obtained with a specific ProM version.
