I like to actually realize my ideas as working software. 
I take pride in going the extra mile to make software that is actually usable, performant, and has proper APIs that can be built upon. 
My main development is currently done in *Java*, *R*, and *JavaScript*. However, I occasionally also develop in *Python* and *C#*.

I contribute to the open-source projects **ProM** and **bupaR**, more information can be found here:
* [bupaR](/software/bupar)
* [ProM](/software/prom)

Further work open-sourced work is available on my [Github page](https://github.com/fmannhardt).
