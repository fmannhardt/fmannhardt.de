I like to actually realize my ideas as working software. My main development work is currently done in *Java*, *R*, and *JavaScript*. 
However, I occasionally also develop in *Python* and *C#*.

I actively contribute to the open-source projects **ProM** and **bupaR**, more information can be found here:
* [bupaR](/software/bupar)
* [ProM](/software/prom)

Further open-sourced work is available on my [Github page](https://github.com/fmannhardt).
