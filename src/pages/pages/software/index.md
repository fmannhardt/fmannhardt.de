I like to actually realize my ideas as working software. I take pride in going the extra mile to make software that is actually usable, performant, and has proper APIs that can be built upon. Of course, given the time available for developing sometimes those ideals are sacrificed for meeting a deadline. My main development is currently done in *Java*, *R*, and *JavaScript*. However, I occasionally also develop in *Python* and *C#*.

I am contributer to the open-source projects **ProM** and **bupaR**. More information about my contributions can be found here:
